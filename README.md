SwingPro: A.I. powered golf swing comparison and analyzer tool.

A new computer vision project is underway! I'm using a cutting-edge neural network from researchers at Google to build a model that will tell you what PGA Tour professional your golf swing most closely resembles. Additional functionality may include frame-by-frame joint tracking using OpenPose, and side by side comparison to PGA pros. The end goal is to package this all together in an iOS app (to be built using Swift).
